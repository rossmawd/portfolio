# My Portfolio

this is my portfolio
this is a new change

## This is my work
eating food

## Here I start with a new branch
how do I merge this brnach with the master?

## The initial 'pull request'
once I created this branch and 'published' with the little cloud icon, git hub had a 'pull request' button on the repo...will pushing changes to this branch now auto merge with the master? ha
